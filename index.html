Stake ADA and Earn Rewards
Stake Your ADA with the YOGI Pool & Earn Rewards With a Low Fee 

Why Stake ADA?
If you decide to stake your Cardano (ADA tokens) for a set period of time, youâ€™ll periodically earn a return on your investment. Staking also helps the Cardano network: it is the process by which validators are selected to create a new block and process transactions.

Here at YOGI Stake Pool we want our delegates to get the best experience possible and earn the most rewards possible. This is why we have a super low fee! We pride ourselves on ALWAYS staying connected and having the highest level of security
